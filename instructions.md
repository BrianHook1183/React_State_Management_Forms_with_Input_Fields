# React State Management: Forms with Input Fields
## Instructions
Write a component `DogForm` in `DogForm.jsx`. It should have a form with three input fields: `name`, `breed`, `age`, in that order. The input fields should all take strings. There should be a submission button. After submission, log the values to the console and clear the input fields.

Here is what the logs to the console might look like:

`"Rufus" "pit bull" "2"`

`"Bingo" "terrier" "5"`
